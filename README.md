# reactworkshop
These are my raw thoughts as I work through the modules. The context for my comments: I am a complete beginner. I have worked through basics for HTML, CSS, and most of a Javascript course on Codecademy. I have not applied these. My knowledge is pretty limited, so there are very basic things I do not know/remember.

# Setup and Module 1
## 01/27/18 
* 12:00

   Figuring out how to set up Git and Github. Figuring out how to find/look at/edit these files in VSCode.

* 13:00

   Dave kindly called in to help me set it up.

* 13:50
   Reading carefully through Module 1. It is not entirely over my head, but even concepts like "parent component" are things I have to infer. The example code of the counter is also not entirely gibberish to me, so I'm putting trust in the course that I will have more confidence looking at this kind of syntax later. Currently thinking, "Should I run through a basic JS course first, as a refresher? Am I too much of a beginner?"

# Module 2
## 01/27/18 
            * 14:00 -- "Oh wait, Redux is it's own thing too. What is it?" Googled 'Redux.'
            * 14:05 -- Had to open workshop instructions on Github, because I didn't know what ```bash meant. I get what it's doing now, haha. As for "git init", I think my repo is already initialized? Do I type "npm init" into the Workshop's cloned repo, or my own?
            * 14:15 -- Dave explains that this is all in the context of my project, so I should be working from the terminal in my own window.
            * 14:35 -- Figured out how to show hidden files so I could copy .gitignore into my project directory through Finder.
            * 14:36 -- Assume that "accept the defaults" means to hit enter many times... and yes, it does! Yay, my first json file!
            * 14:39 -- Installing Babel. Wondering, "Is this installed for all future projects, or just my current project? My assumption is all." This intall comes with the following warnings:
                            * npm WARN deprecated babel-preset-es2015@6.24.1: ðŸ™Œ  Thanks for using Babel: we recommend using babel-preset-env now: please read babeljs.io/env to update!
                            * npm WARN babel-loader@7.1.2 requires a peer of webpack@2 || 3 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
            * 14:40 -- The webpack install comes with the following warnings:
                            * npm WARN babel-loader@7.1.2 requires a peer of webpack@2 || 3 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
                            * npm WARN webpack-dev-server@2.11.1 requires a peer of webpack@^2.2.0 || ^3.0.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
                            * npm WARN webpack-dev-middleware@1.12.2 requires a peer of webpack@^1.0.0 || ^2.0.0 || ^3.0.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
            * 14:41 -- I've heard of SASS as well as LESS, I think? My current understanding is that these compilers take my code and translate it into some kind of style sheet, but I'm really unsure. Why use SASS over LESS? This comes with the following warnings:
                            * npm WARN babel-loader@7.1.2 requires a peer of webpack@2 || 3 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
                            * npm WARN webpack-dev-middleware@1.12.2 requires a peer of webpack@^1.0.0 || ^2.0.0 || ^3.0.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
                            * npm WARN webpack-dev-server@2.11.1 requires a peer of webpack@^2.2.0 || ^3.0.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
                            * npm WARN sass-loader@6.0.6 requires a peer of webpack@^2.0.0 || >= 3.0.0-rc.0 || ^3.0.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
                            * npm WARN schema-utils@0.4.3 requires a peer of webpack@^2.0.0 || ^3.0.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
            * 14:48 -- Wondering when I should commit changes? Is this something that should be done very often, like saving my design files, or should I wait until I'm a ways in? Currently waiting to see if the instructions say, "Commit now."
            * 14:51 -- Have created the basic application structure. Already seeing a difference in files. My project has created a "node_modules" folder that I do not see in the workshop files. The folder has over 16,000 files in it, haha.
            * 14:56 -- Inserted scripts into the package.json file and ran Start. Got the following errors:
                            * npm ERR! missing script: start
                            * npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
                            * npm ERR!     /Users/mia/.npm/_logs/2018-01-27T19_54_58_707Z-debug.log
                     So the start script is still missing somehow... Maybe I should go ahead and commit all of my files. That may help them work together?
            * 15:01 -- Um, yes, saving changes definitely helps, haha. But now I'm getting a LOT of errors, starting with not being able to "find
                     module 'webpack'". I think I will end it here for today and forward my issues to Dave.
            * 15:12 -- Maybe I should figure out formatting so I don't make Dave's eyes bleed.
